By using precompiled binaries,   the compiler has less work to do because portions of the code have already   been compiled. It doesn't need to parse and compile the same headers over and   over again. Developers will refuse to use libhal if it results in extremely   long compilation times. They will tire of the project and seek faster to   compile alternatives.</li> <li>\u2705 Consistency: With precompiled binaries, you can be sure that the same   code will be compiled in the same way, which can reduce inconsistencies   between different environments or build configurations. libhal will not be   taken seriously if libhal didn't use prebuilt binaries and also support   producing them. Distributing consistent code in a consistent form will be a   requirement for many organizations seeking to use libhal.</li> <li>\ud83d\udce6 Code distribution and updates: When distributing C++ code, rather than   give out the full source code or require users to compile it themselves,   providing a precompiled binary is more user-friendly. Updates to the program   can also be handled by replacing the old binaries with the new ones, without   requiring the end-user to handle the compilation process. The philosophy of   conan regarding library packages is that, at their core, C++ libraries are   header files and prebuilt binaries.</li> <li>\ud83d\udd12 Protection of Intellectual Property: Precompiled binaries are much   harder to reverse-engineer than raw source code. If a developer wants to   write an application and distribute the binary, but the C++ code contains   proprietary algorithms or trade secrets that you don't want to expose to the   public, distributing it as a precompiled binary can provide an additional   layer of protection.</li> </ul> <p>In order to provide the best experience for our developers as well as necessary features of the platform, libhal emphasizes prebuilt libraries over header only.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Why the sudden change from A.4 to this? Supporting header-only made bringing up libhal much easier. The process of implementing prebuilt binaries required adding additional architecture settings, required the use of conan profiles to make the arm-gnu-toolchain available globally for all packages, figuring out how to insert architectural compiler flags and ensure they propogate to all packages took time and was a complex process.

More and more of the embedded world move away from C and towards C++. This has to do with the many benefits of C++ such as type safety, compile time features, meta-programming, multi-paradigm and much more. When these features are used correctly, they can result in smaller binary sizes and higher performance code than in C.</p> <p>But a problem that embedded C++ software suffers is that there isn't a consistent and common API for embedded libraries. Looking around, you will find that each hardware vendor has their own set of libraries and tools for their specific products. If you write a driver on top of their libraries, you will find that your code will only work for that specific platform/product. In some cases you may also be limited to just their toolchain. You as the developer are locked in to this one specific setup. And if you move to another platform, you must do the work of rewriting all of your code again.</p> <p>libhal seeks to solve this issue by creating a set of generic interfaces for embedded system concepts such as serial communication (UART), analog to digital conversion (ADC), inertial measurement units (IMU), pulse width modulation (PWM) and much more.

Each class with virtual functions has a vtable, which is essentially a static array of function pointers. This vtable is shared among all instances of the class, so it doesn't increase the per-instance memory overhead.</p> <p>The vtable does increase the size of the binary, but the increase is usually small. Each vtable entry is just a function pointer. For a class hierarchy with a reasonable number of virtual functions, this overhead is typically negligible.</p> <p>In addition to the function pointers, the vtable contains two more pointers: one for the parent class's vtable (for supporting inheritance) and one for Run-Time Type Information (RTTI, used for <code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>). These are fixed overheads per class, not per object.</p> <p>In conclusion, while dynamic polymorphism in C++ does have some overhead, it's often smaller than people think. It doesn't inherently require dynamic memory, its performance is comparable to other forms of polymorphism, and its memory overhead is typically small. Therefore, it's a powerful tool for creating flexible and reusable code in C++.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/policy/","title":"\u2696\ufe0f Policies &amp; FAQ","text":""},{"location":"user_guide/policy/#1-ensuring-consistency-across-platforms","title":"1.

Once you mock components like i2c or input pins, the actual device testing veers towards simulation. This method is viable post verifying the device compatibility, solidifying the code behavior through unit tests. High-level conceptual and application codes can harness such tests, but unit testing often misaligns with low-level drivers.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/policy/#2-driver-development-in-libhal","title":"2.
